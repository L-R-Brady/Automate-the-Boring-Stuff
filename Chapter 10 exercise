Issues found:
#both heads and tails return 0
#0 is returned instead of heads or tails
#guess was spelt guesss, so second user input was never accepted

Fixes:
#removed random.randint and added choices using random.choice(choices) to pick either heads or tails
#removed random.randint, also added .lower() to allow for any uppercase or lowercase spellings for input
#spelt guess correctly
